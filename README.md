# Solana Game SDK for Unreal Engine

## Overview

The Solana Game SDK is an Unreal Engine plugin that enables game developers to easily integrate Solana blockchain functionality into their games. This SDK provides a bridge between Unreal Engine and the Solana blockchain, allowing for seamless implementation of features such as wallet management, token transactions, NFT minting and trading, and marketplace interactions.

## Features

- **Wallet Management**: Create and manage Solana wallets within your game.
- **Token Transactions**: Send and receive SOL and other SPL tokens.
- **NFT Integration**: Mint, transfer, and manage NFTs directly from your game.
- **Marketplace Functionality**: List items for sale and facilitate purchases using Solana.
- **Blueprint Support**: All functions are exposed to Blueprints for easy integration without C++ coding.

### Marketplace
- `ListItemForSale`: Lists an item (NFT) for sale.
- `BuyItem`: Purchases a listed item.

For detailed function signatures and usage, please refer to the [API Documentation].

## Configuration

The plugin can be configured through the project settings in the Unreal Editor. Navigate to Project Settings > Plugins > Solana Game SDK to adjust settings such as:

- RPC Node URL
- Network selection (Mainnet, Testnet, Devnet)
- Default transaction confirmation strategy

## Best Practices

- Always test thoroughly on Solana's testnet or devnet before deploying to mainnet.
- Implement proper error handling for blockchain interactions.
- Consider implementing a caching mechanism to reduce unnecessary blockchain queries.
- Use gasless transactions or meta-transactions where possible to improve user experience.
